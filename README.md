# AuthorPal
## Quick Overview
Hate pencils? Desire Relief? Start planning your next novel/screenplay/etc digitally.
### Update! Now supports (alpha) markdown blogs!

Lycelia's AuthorPal can be used either online (https://penguinofthesky.github.io/AuthorPal/) or as a "desktop" app (simply download (button top-right) and double-click index.html to run program). Benefit of having a local copy is the ability to add images from your computer without using a hosting service (images must be in same or child folder).   

Product is built to be Chrome compatible.  Should work in safari/opera as well but not tested. Will work in Firefox/Edge as soon as they make it to 2012 technology and finally implement shadow dom.  

FAQ is included in product.
